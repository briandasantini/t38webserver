# Restraint Stage 2, T=300K, molecular dynamics long time run (PME, restart)
 &cntrl
	! GENERAL FLAGS DESCRIBING THE CALCULATION
  	imin=0, 						! Flag to run minimzation (=1 perform energy minimizatin) 
	
	
	! NATURE AND FORMAT OF THE INPUT
	ntx=5,							! Flag to read the coordinates and velocities from an ASCII coordinate file (=1 coord. but no velocities, deafult)
	irest=1,						! Flag to restart the simulations with velocities and step counter from before (=0 do not restart sim, instead run new sim; default)
	
	! NATURE AND FORMAT OF THE OUTPUT	
	ntpr=500,						! Num of Timesteps to Print Readable energy information
	ntwx=500,						! freq of writing coordinates to the mdcrd file
    iwrap=0,						! If iwrap = 1, the coordinates written to the restart and trajectory files will be "wrapped" into a primary
			  						! box, may be required to keep the coordinate output from overflowing; If iwrap = 0, no wrapping; Default=0

	! FROZEN OR RESTRAINED ATOMS
	ntr=1,							! Flag for restraining specified atoms in Cartesian space using a harmonic potential, if ntr > 0, Deafult=0
	restraint_wt=1.0,				! The weight (in kcal/mol−Å^2) for the positional restraints.
	restraintmask='(:1-287 & !@H=)',! String that specifies the restrained atoms when ntr=1.
	
	! MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
nstlim=5000, 						! Number of MD-steps to be performed. Default 1.
	dt=0.004,						! time step (psec), 0.004 possible if prmtop parmed with the HMassRepartition option
	
	! TEMPERATURE REGULATION
	ntt=1,							! Specifies temperature scaling. =0: Constant total energy, assuming ntb < 2; =1: Constant temperature, with weak-coupling
temp0=300.0,						! Reference temperature at which the system is to be kept, if ntt > 0
	tautp=0.1,						! Specifies the time constant (in ps) when ntt = 1. Values should range from 0.5-5.0 ps;=1.0 (Default)	

	! PRESSURE REGULATION
	ntp=1,							! Flag for constant pressure dynamics. =0 No pressure scaling (Default); =1 md with isotropic position scaling
	taup=0.1,						! Specifies the pressure relaxation time when nto> 0. Recommended to be between 1-5 ps. =1.0 (Default)
	
	! SHAKE BOND LENGTH CONTRAINTS
	ntc=2,							! Flag for SHAKE to perform bond length constraints. =1 SHAKE is not performed (default). =2 bonds involving hydrogen are constrained; TIP3P set NTF=NTC=2. 
									! = 3 all bonds are constrained (not available for parallel or qmmm runs in sander)
	
	! GENERIC PARAMETERS
	ntf=2,							! Force evaluation. If SHAKE is used (see NTC), it is not necessary to calculate forces for the constrained bonds.
									! = 1 complete interaction is calculated (default)
									! = 2 bond interactions involving H-atoms omitted (use with NTC=2)
									! = 3 all the bond interactions are omitted (use with NTC=3)
	ntb=2,							! Flag for periodic boundaries. = 0 no periodicity is applied and PME is off (default when igb > 0)
									! = 1 constant volume (default when igb and ntp are both 0, which are their defaults)
									! = 2 constant pressure (default when ntp > 0)
	dielc=1.0,						! Dielectric multiplicative constant for the electrostatic interactions. Default is 1.0. 
	cut=8.5,						! Flag that specifies the nonbonded cutoff in Angstrom
