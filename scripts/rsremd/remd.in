# MD input for pull simulation & Umbrella Sampling
 &cntrl
	! GENERAL FLAGS DESCRIBING THE CALCULATION
	! NATURE AND FORMAT OF THE INPUT
	ntx=5,		! Flag to read the coordinates and velocities from an ASCII coordinate file
	irest=1,	! Flag to restart the simulations with velocities and step counter from before

	! NATURE AND FORMAT OF THE OUTPUT	
	ntxo=2, 	! Format of final coordinates, here NetCDF file
	ntpr=10000,	! Num of Timesteps to Print Readable energy information
	ntwr=10000,	! Number of timesteps to write out a backup restrt file
	iwrap=0,	! Coordinates written to the restart and trajectory files will be "wrapped" into a primary box
	ntwx=10000,	! Freq of writing coordinates to the mdcrd file
	ioutfm=1,       ! Format of coordinate and velocity trajectory files; =1 means NetCDF traj

	! FROZEN OR RESTRAINT ATOMS
	ntr=0, 		! Restraining specific atoms; =0 means no restraints

	! MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
	nstlim=250,	! Number of MD steps to be performed between exchange attempts (here every picosecond)
	nscm=0,         ! Removal of translational and rotational center-of-mass motion at regular intervals
	dt=0.004,	! Time step in ps, 0.002 works by repartitioning the H-weights
	numexchg=5000, ! Number of exchange attempts, total simulation length will be numexch * nstlim * dt

	! TEMPERATURE REGULATION
	ntt=3,		! Flag for the coupling algorithm; ntt=1 means weak coupling
	temp0=300.0,	! Reference temperature to be kept by the system
	tautp=5.0, 	! Time constant, in ps, for heat bath coupling for the system
	gamma_ln=2.0, 	! Collision frequency when ntt=3

	! PRESSURE REGULATION
	ntp=0,		! Flag for pressure coupling; 1 means weak coupling but NVT should be equilibrated before NPT

	! SHAKE BOND LENGTH CONSTRAINTS
	ntc=2,		! Specifies SHAKE constraints; only H-bonds in this case

	! POTENTIAL FUNCTION PARAMETERS
	ntf=2,		! Manipulates the force evaluation; 2 means no H-Bond evaluation
	ntb=1,		! Periodic Boundary Conditions, =1 means constant volume
	cut=9.0,	! Flag that specifies the nonbonded cutoff in Angstrom

	! GB/SA INPUT PARAMETERS
  	igb=0, 		! Explicit water
